### Short Bio

Since November 2022, I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Inria Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-saclay-centre) in the [Mind team](https://team.inria.fr/mind/), supervised by [Bertrand Thirion](https://pages.saclay.inria.fr/bertrand.thirion/), [Alexandre Gramfort](http://alexandre.gramfort.net) and [Rémi Flamary](https://remi.flamary.com).

Previously, I did my PhD in the [SONDRA](https://sondra.fr/) laboratory at [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en), [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en). My supervisors were [Jean-Philippe Ovarlez](http://www.jeanphilippeovarlez.com), [Guillaume Ginolhac](https://www.univ-smb.fr/listic/presentation/membres/enseignants-chercheurs/guillaume-ginolhac/), [Chengfang Ren](https://sites.google.com/view/chengfangren/), and [Arnaud Breloy](https://abreloy.github.io).

I previously graduated from the [University of Technology of Compiègne](https://www.utc.fr/en/) with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematical modeling.

My research focuses on statistics lying on Riemannian manifolds and their applications to machine learning and signal processing problems.
I mainly work on remote sensing images (e.g., SAR and hyperspectral) and neuroimaging data (e.g., MEG, EEG and fMRI).

In 2022, I received the **"Best student paper award"** from the EUSIPCO conference for the paper "Robust Geometric Metric Learning".

In parallel, I am a part-time lecturer at CentraleSupélec and University Paris-Saclay since 2020, teaching graduate-level applied mathematics, including optimization (convexity, duality, linear programming, ...) and digital signal processing (Fourier analysis, linear regression, stochastic processes, statistical estimation, ...).

My curriculum vitae - résumé - is available here: [short version](assets/pdf/antoine_collas_short.pdf), [long version](assets/pdf/antoine_collas_long.pdf) (updated in August 2024).
